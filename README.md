Healthcare: Leveraging customer information is paramount for most businesses. In the case of an insurance company, attributes of customers like the ones mentioned below can be crucial in making business decisions. Hence, knowing to explore and generate value out of such data can be an invaluable skill to 
have.

Banking: This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing 
department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget.
